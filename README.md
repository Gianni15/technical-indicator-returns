# technical-indicator-returns
Simple R file designed to show returns generated by different technical indicator strategies while day-trading a stock.

This is a simple R file using the packages quantmod, TTR, and PerformanceAnalytics to map out the returns that would have been generated using three different technical indicator strategies over the past 3 years.

The program assumes 2 things about your day-trading:
  1) You go all in on every trade with your portfolio
  2) You only trade AAPL

The three different technical indicator strategies modeled are:
  1) Using EMA 20-day and EMA 100-day to provide buy and sell signals
  2) Using EMA 20-day and EMA 100-day to provide buy signals and RSI 14-day > 70 to provide sell signals
  3) Using CCI 30-day > 0 to provide buy signals and RSI 14-day > 70 to provide sell signals.
